# libraryproject
a mini library, project for database system design class.

Setup your machine (Important):
- if you do not have node js, download at: https://nodejs.org/ 
- Open command line (window), check if you are properly installing node, by type in to see version of node: node -v
- Once you're done, unzip my libproj.
- If you run my khanh_nguyen_backend.sql, I have a screen shot include: khanh_nguyen_databse_host_screenshot in the same folder as this README to show my host setup. Make sure you have the same setup, as I hard coded these to connect to my front-end.
- Go to commandline, cd into libproj folder
- In command line, type: node index.js
- Go to chrome browser, type in: http://localhost:8080/login.html

- If you have any problem and can't start my app, please email me via: knguyen6@uw.edu.
